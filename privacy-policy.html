            <h3>
              GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING
              INFORMATION
            </h3>
            <h4>Users of the Website Generally</h4>
            <p>
              “Non-Personally Identifying Information” is information that,
              without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
              associated with a specific person. “Personally Identifying
              Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email
              address that, without more, can be directly associated with a
              specific person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the
              Website Non-Personally Identifying Information of the sort that
              Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
              That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP)
              address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the
              websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating
              and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such
              information is not Personally Identifying Information, it may be
              possible for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s
              Internet service provider and the geographic location of the
              visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage
              data. Company analyzes Non-Personally Identifying Information
              gathered from users of the Website to help Company better
              understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns
              and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website
              to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease
              of use.
            </p>
            <p>
              From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally
              Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the
              aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage
              of the Website.
            </p>

            <h4>Web Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a
              unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer,
              and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the
              user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website
              to keep track of services you have used, to record registration
              information regarding your login name and password, to record your
              user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website and to
              facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to
              track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both
              to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company
              understand how the Website is being used. As with other
              Non-Personally Identifying Information gathered from users of the
              Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form
              information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its
              partners and others better understand how the Website is being
              used.

                >COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON
                THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES
                BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT
                CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY
                WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB
                COOKIES MAY LOSE FUNCTIONALITY OR USE OF CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE
                WEBSITE.</strong

            <h4>Third-Party Advertisers</h4>
            <p>
              We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
              visit the Website. These companies may use information about your
              visits to the Website and other websites that are contained in Web
              Cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and
              services of interest to you. Using a tool created by the Network
              Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third-party ad
              servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously. If you would
              like more information about this practice and to know your choices
              about not having this information used by these companies, please

              third-party advertising companies we are currently using to serve
              ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users
              who will see their advertisements, and we may use any of the
              Non-Personally Identifying Information we have collected
              (including information you may have decided not to show to other
              users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal
              information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for
              those advertisements. We do not identify you to the advertiser.
            </p>

            <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
            <p>
              A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or
              email that is usually invisible to the user and allows website
              operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page
              or an email. Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in
              emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed
              emails and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not
              used to access users’ Personally Identifying Information. They are
              a technique Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about
              Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of
              information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a
              page or email view and a description of the page or email on which
              the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons. However,
              they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or
              modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web
              Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline Web
              Cookies on an individual basis.
            </p>

            <h4>Analytics</h4>
            <p>
              We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use
              first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and
              third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to
              inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past activity on the
              Website, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The
              information collected may be used to, among other things, analyze
              and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and
              better understand online activity. If you do not want any
              information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, you can
              install an opt-out in your web browser (<a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"

                >https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a
              >) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or
              the Google Display Network by using Google’s Ads help (<a

              >).

            <h4>Aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information</h4>
            <p>
              We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information
              we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share
              it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and
              deliver targeted advertising on the Website and on websites of
              third parties. We may combine Non-Personally Identifying
              Information we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying
              Information collected from other sources. We also may share
              aggregated information with third parties, including advisors,
              advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general
              business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the
              number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features or
              services accessed. This information does not contain any
              Personally Identifying Information and may be used to develop
              website content and services that we hope you and other users will
              find of interest and to target content and advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, Company may make use of de-identified information in
              accordance with applicable privacy law.

            <p>
              We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect you to a
              social network if you click on the respective link. However, when
              you click on a social plug-in, such as Facebook’s “Like” button,
              Twitter’s “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social
              network’s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly
              connect to that provider’s servers. If you do not use these
              buttons, none of your data will be sent to the respective social
              network’s plugin provider. So for example, when you click on the
              Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website, Facebook will receive
              your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and
              the operating system of the device you have used to access the
              Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the
              websites of these social networks and are not within our control.
